Philadelphia Historical Sites Day Trip Planner

This project is an interactive web map that explores historical sites in Philadelphia and their surrounding urban context, including food retail availability and parks and recreation sites. The map is designed as a simple “day trip planner,” allowing users to search for historic sites and understand their relationship to nearby amenities.

The project was created using Leaflet.js, GeoJSON, and the Fetch API, with an emphasis on layered spatial visualization and basic user interaction.

🗺️ Map Layers & Styling Logic

Layer drawing order is controlled using Leaflet panes to ensure correct visual hierarchy:
Food Retail 
Historic Sites
Parks and Recreation 
Food retail density is represented using opacity levels instead of multiple colors to maintain a clean and accessible visual language.

🔄 Public Engagement & User Contribution

To extend the dashboard beyond passive exploration, this project introduces a lightweight public engagement feature that allows users to contribute their own perspectives on Philadelphia’s historic sites.

Users can click on any historic site on the map and submit a rating (1–5) along with a short written comment reflecting their experience, impressions, or historical interest. These user-generated reviews are stored in a Firebase Cloud Firestore database, creating a growing archive of public feedback associated with each site.

This engagement feature transforms the map from a static visualization into a participatory planning tool, encouraging users to reflect on cultural value, accessibility, and personal experience. Over time, collected ratings and comments can support comparative analysis of historic sites and inform future interpretations of heritage landscapes.
